      <h2>January 10</h2>
      <p><b>The Mandalorian Armor</b><br><i>Book 1 of The Bounty Hunter Wars.</i> This is a great book full of 
        suprises and twists in the story. Things that you wouldn't expect to happen. It was actually the first book 
        I read that gave me a full view of Boba Fett, the notorious bounty hunter. This is a must if you want to 
        know what happened to Boba after being eaten by a Sarlacc in Episode 6: Return of the Jedi.</p>

      <p><b>Slave Ship</b><br><i>Book 2 of The Bounty Hunter Wars.</i> Good book. Features the rise of Bossk to
      power after he kills his dad, as is the trandoshan way. This leads to the Bounty Hunters' Guild to split
      into two factions, the True Guild, which is comprised of the older bounty hunters, and the Guild Reform Committe,
      which is primarily comprised of the younger bounty hunters lead by Bossk. Reaching the end of the book, Xizor
      makes an unlikely alliance with a subnode. This was the first time I read a book featuring the bounty of a 
      stormtrooper.</p>

      <h2>January 15</h2>
      <p><b>Hard Merchandise</b><br><i>Book 3 of The Bounty Hunter Wars.</i> This was a great book. To see Boba
      Fett struggle throughout several parts of the book was very interesting, considering he's regarded as the 
      best bounty hunter. In the last book of the series, Jeter (the author) really got into it, making the final 
      book exciting.</p>

      <h2>January 18</h2>
      <p><b>A New Dawn</b><br> Great book that gives you details about the characters in the Rebels series. Kanan 
      really behaves as a Jedi while hiding from the empire after order 66. To see him change from a miserable man 
      consumed by sorrow and regret who does not help others so that the empire can't find and hunt him to a Jedi who 
      knows the true path is very cool. And it gets better once he meets with Hera and the adventure begins aboard 
      the Ghost. I recommend reading this book before watching Rebels.</p>

      <h2>January 20</h2>
      <p><b>Lords of the Sith</b><br> Hands down one of <i>the</i> greatest books I've read in my entire life! 
      To see (in my imagination) the emperor and Vader fighting together for survival was awesome. In this book 
      I found out that some of the best clones were promoted to Imperial Guards, so even years after the end of 
      the war there were clones still in service. The power of both, the emperor and Vader, was described 
      explicitly with several adventures in their quest for safety after being shot down by rebels.</p>

      <h2>January 21</h2>
      <p><b>Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader</b><br> Awesome book! I'm an all-time fan of Vader and this book 
      totally kills it! There was a time where I wondered how Anakin got used to the suit and all its enhancements 
      and life support. Well, this book tells you that and more. Anakin Skywalker was proficient in 6 of the 7 
      lighsaber forms, but he favored Form IV. After his defeat against Obi-wan, Anakin, now Vader, had different 
      speed, strength and mobility, thus requiring a new form of combat. So Vader creates a hybrid of Form II 
      and Form V, which enabled him to fight better in his new suit. This book also explores the process of how 
      Vader got used to his suit, as well finding out a couple of things that he could no longer do and other 
      things that he could now do. The films and series portray Darth Vader as the invincible Sith Lord, but 
      they fail to show the audience how he got there.</p>

        <h2>January 28</h2>
        <p><b>Heir to the Jedi</b><br> Great book that portrays a couple of adventures and a mission of Luke 
        Skywalker as he begins to use his powers. In this book we see a young Luke who is learning how to control 
        the Force. I believe this book is quite important because we only see a great change of Luke's powers 
        from one movie to another. This makes people wonder how Luke got so good in such a short time, but in reality
        it took him a long time to master everything.</p>

          <h2>February 9</h2>
          <p><b>The Old Republic: Revan</b><br> The. Coolest. Book. Ever! Every true fan loves the Old Republic 
          times and to see Revan in action is breathtaking. Revan is one of the most powerful Jedi/Sith in history. 
          He shares first place with Darth Vader as my two #1 characters. Revan was a Jedi Knight who led other 
          Jedi, known as Revanchists, in the Mandalorian Wars. He defeated Mandalore the Ultimate in single-combat 
          and activated the Mass Shadow Generator, ending the Mandalorian Wars. Revan goes into the Unknown Regions 
          and delays the Sith Emperor from attacking the Republic. Revan was known as the prodigal knight due to 
          the fact that he went from Jedi Knight to Sith Lord and back. This book gave me the chills. Literal chills, 
          guys.</p>

            <h2>February 17</h2>
            <p><b>Death Troopers</b><br> Awesome book! An imperial prison barge breaks down and it's stranded, but 
            hope appears to come as they encounter a star destroyer drifting in space, seemingly abandoned. The characters 
            find out that there is a deadly virus aboard the stranded ship. Around the middle section of the book, the 
            doctor goes to the isolation cells and sets free Han Solo and Chewbacca. Han and Chewie attempt to escape 
            the infected destroyers, now knowing full well that the deadly virus kills the host and turns it ito a 
            zombie. Great thriller with lots of suspense.</p>

            <h2>February 21</h2>
            <p><b>The Fall of Reach</b><br> Very cool book. It tells the story of how the Spartan II program started. 
              The main character is John-117. The book goes on about how John and the other recruits went on from 
              simple recruits to full-on Spartan IIs. I love this book and all others from Halo. They make me remember
              simpler times. I've read this book a thousand times and I still enjoy it as if it was the first time I read 
              it. I truly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a great time reading about Sci-Fi with a much 
              common storytelling. It's actually based on something that could happen in reality.</p>

            <h2>February 28</h2>
            <p><b>Silent Storm</b><br> Great book! Whilst the book <i>The Fall of Reach</i> shows us the training given in the 
              Spartan II program, it skips a few years so as to tell us the true story of the book, the actual fall of reach to 
              the Covenant. In this book, then, we know how John-117 rose to the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer, as he is also 
              known. The Master Chief has always been a hero to me, taking on the Covenant head on. But the perfection of this book is 
              that it humanizes our heroes, in this case, my hero.</p>
