# StarWarsTimeline
Timeline about the Star Wars novels in chronological order.<br>

This webpage will include the Star Wars novels in chronological order, as well as the books I read.<br>

I will start with a simple interface with 3 buttons.<br>
1. The Home button will be used to keep track of the books I read throughout the year or, possibly, my life. This will be starting on January 1, 2019.
2. The Timeline button will feature the actual timeline from Legends and Cannon. This will help me and others to know which books I currently have, which will be marked or crossed, and which books I'm still missing to complete my collection. It can also be a simple list or search.
3. This one is still in development.

###Things to do
[ ] Complete homepage adding all the books read until this day.
[ ] Complete the whole Star Wars timeline merging the Legends and Cannon timelines creating a new, hybrid timeline.
[ ] Brainstorming for the remaining button.
[ ] Give it a nice UX.
